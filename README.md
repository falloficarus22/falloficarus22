_"icarus didn’t fall for flying, he fell for ignoring limits"_

I’m Abhishek.

- I spend most of my time learning how machines perceive, decide, and act —
especially when they have to deal with the real world.

- I’m interested in robotics, AI, and learning systems,
and in the gap between elegant theory and messy execution.

- Robots appeal to me because they don’t tolerate hand-waving.
If something is wrong, it shows up in motion, timing, or failure.

- I care about open source because it’s how I learned most of what I know,
and because progress feels hollow if it isn’t shared.

Still learning.
Still building.
Trying to understand limits before testing them.
