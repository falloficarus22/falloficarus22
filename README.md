## Focus Areas
- AI Agent architectures & tool-using systems  
- Deep Learning with PyTorch  
- NLP model development & modern transformer techniques
- Reinforcement Learning algorithms  

---

## Projects
### **BitGrad**
A custom deep learning optimizer inspired by biological learning and gradient-based updates.  
Designed to experiment with alternative optimization behaviors beyond Adam/SGD.
Inspired by Karpathy's micrograd

### **PPO Trading Agent**
A reinforcement learning agent trained using **Proximal Policy Optimization** for algorithmic trading.  
Focus on stable returns, reward engineering, environment design, and policy performance monitoring.

### **Echelon (WIP)**
An **AI-powered chess engine**, combining:
- NNUE-based evaluation  
- Search-based planning
- Agentic decision loops
A personal research project to explore competitive game-playing AI.
